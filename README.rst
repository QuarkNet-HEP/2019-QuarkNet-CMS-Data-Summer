What is ROOT?
=============

ROOT is a file format developed and used by CERN to keep large amounts of data
organized and accessible. Each ROOT file serves as it's own directory, keeping
data in objects similar to jagged arrays. It is written and typically used in
C++, but has been integrated into both Python and R.
