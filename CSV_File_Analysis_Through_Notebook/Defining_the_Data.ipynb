There are other variables that are likely to have been recorded for this event and having the event number makes it possible to find that from the original data set.  The likelyhood that you will need to do this is very small.  For our purposes, event number data is much like the run number: a way of indexing the collision."

    "\"pt1\" and \"pt2\" are the transverse momenta of the two muons.  Transverse indicates the x-y plane, so this does not include the momentum in the z-direction.  The z-direction is along the beamline.  Momentum along the beamline is not worked with quite as often as transverse momentum because of how the collisions work.  To have a collision occur, it will be positioned at the radial center of the detector (along the central axis of the cylinder)  Since the beams of protons travel along this axis to collide, there isn't any initial momentum in the x-y plane for the protons pre-collision.  There is some uncertainty about the z momentum of the colliding particles before the collision since there is some uncertainty about what parts of the protons are colliding.  Therefore we use the transverse momentum more than the momentum along the beamline."

Eta is not an angle (what you might use in most non-detector systems to measure how close to or far away from an axis you are), but something called \"pseudorapidity.\"  Eta ranges from 0 at points perpendicular to the beamline axis to a little over 5 along the beamline.  The distribution of eta is not even over the space like an angle in degrees or radians.  It is defined to have each measurement of eta picked up in approximately the same amount of detector material.  Some useful information on eta is available at http://www.hephy.at/user/friedl/diss/html/node8.html"
