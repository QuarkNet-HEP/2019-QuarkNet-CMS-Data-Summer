What is ROOT?
=============

ROOT is a file format developed and used by CERN to keep large amounts of data
organized and accessible. Each ROOT file serves as it's own directory, keeping
data in objects similar to jagged arrays. It is written and typically used in
C++, but has been integrated into both Python and R.

How to Install
==============

An installation guide for ROOT can be found `here <https://root.cern/downloading-root/>`_.

ROOT can be dowloaded and used on any device, however it is more useful when
it is used in CERN's virtual machine, CERNVM.
