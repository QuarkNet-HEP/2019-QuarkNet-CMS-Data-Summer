Spyder Tutorial
========================

Introduction
------------

Spyder is a Python IDE that we used for most of the duration of Quarknet Summer 2019. All the programs in this directory were written with python 2 except the uproot one which was written in python 3. What our uses entailed was that we programed a function to analyze CMS data and plot out histograms to extrapolate and interpolate the data. This was mainly used for data that was in a csv file format or a basic root format
