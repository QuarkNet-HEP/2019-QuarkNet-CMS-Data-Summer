Spyder Tutorial
========================

Introduction
------------

Spyder is a Python IDE that we used for most of the duration of Quarknet Summer 2019. All the programs in this directory were written with python 2 except the uproot one which was written in python 3. What our uses entailed was that we programed a function to analyze CMS data and plot out histograms to extrapolate and interpolate the data. This was mainly used for data that was in a csv file format or a basic root format

Spyder?
=============

Spyder is a python IDE that uses python 3, it allows us to use the terminal and an editor so we can both write and edit code and it highlights mistakes we might make when programming so it is especially useful. 

How to Install
==============

When installing spyder it is generally recommended to use a program called Anaconda which is really useful.
access it with the following link
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
when you see the page choose the Operating System you are running accordingly(ie. Windows, Linux, OS X)
 Install the Python 3 version of Anaconda or the Python 2 version(we will be using 3)
 Anaconda is a pakage that contains numerous useful pakages and libraries for python and it includes the Spyder IDE. 
 if you have a problem when installing when it says file path has a space as an error, you can negate the efects by choosing install on all users.
